Module: detailed_business_requirements.py

Description:
    This module provides an asynchronous function `permissions_buss_req` that generates a detailed list of
    business permissions by combining prompt engineering, document retrieval, and language model inference.
    The function constructs a specialized prompt tailored to extracting permitted actions within a regulatory
    framework, retrieves context documents related to the input query, and then invokes a language model chain
    to generate a clear, step-by-step bullet list of permissions based on an original question and a verbatim business requirement.

Dependencies:
    - asyncio: For asynchronous execution.
    - warnings: To suppress non-critical warnings.
    - os: For interacting with environment variables.
    - dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
    - pandas: Imported for potential data manipulation.
    - io.StringIO: For string-based I/O operations.
    - tiktoken: For tokenization tasks.
    - langchain (and submodules): For building prompt templates, handling language model chains, and parsing outputs.
    - pinecone: For integrating with Pineconeâ€™s vector database.
    - src.business_requirements.retriever: A module for retrieving relevant documents based on a query.
    - src.prompts: Additional prompt configurations.

Usage:
    This module is intended to be used in asynchronous contexts. For example:

        import asyncio
        result = asyncio.run(permissions_buss_req(
            "What are the compliance requirements?",
            "Ensure full regulatory compliance"
        ))
        print(result)

Environment Setup:
    - The OpenAI API key is loaded from an environment variable ('OPENAI_API_KEY').
    - The Pinecone API key is similarly loaded from 'PINECONE_API_KEY'.
    - Any warnings are suppressed for cleaner output.
